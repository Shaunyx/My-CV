			<p>Hey! I'm <strong>Jeremy</strong>, I've been studying  <i>Infographie</i> at <a href="https://www.heaj.be/fr/" target="blank_">HEAJ</a>high school<i> (Haute Ecole Albert Jacquard)</i>.<br />During 3 years at school, option Animation 3D oriented Video Games, I'was involed in "C++" but i wasn't a big fan to be honest.<br />Before high school, i was in an Art school, I was honored with <i>"great distinction"</i> and now I'm into programing languages where i've learned coding like <i>"html", "MySql", "Css"</i>. That was cool and I want to learn more because it's not enough for me ! I love solving  problems and understanding languages!<br/>To be honest, when i was a child ; I was a big fan of a Comic's character, her name was <a href="https://batman.fandom.com/wiki/Oracle_(Arkhamverse)"target="blank_"><i>"the Oracle"</a></i>, she is in the Batman saga and uses a laptop and more engines to help Batman and saves people too ! I don't expect myself to become like that ( maybe one day ) but for the moment i gonna learn more and try to not to be lost with all of existing languages !</p>
